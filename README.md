Gallery: Global Terrorism Database Visualizations
Welcome to the gallery showcasing visualizations derived from the Global Terrorism Database. For detailed insights into the creation process and data categorization, refer to the database manual.

Assumptions
Several assumptions were applied to the data:

Data is analyzed from 2007 to 2017.
Only incidents definitively classified as terrorist attacks are considered.
Incidents with unknown fatalities are assumed to have resulted in no deaths.
These visualizations should be interpreted as conservative estimates.

Deaths by Type of Attack
The chart below depicts a time series of fatalities categorized by type of attack over the entire ten-year period. Notice the significant increase in deaths around and after 2014.



Number of Attacks by Weapon
This plot illustrates the distribution of attacks by weapon type and region. Explosives dominate as the most common weapon type. Note that categories such as fake weapons, biological, and radiological have been excluded due to their rarity.



Attack Locations by Group
Lastly, the map below displays attack locations attributed to the five most lethal terrorist groups. Each dot represents an attack, color-coded by the responsible group.



These visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of the trends and patterns within the Global Terrorism Database, offering valuable insights into the nature and impact of terrorist activities globally.
